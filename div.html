    <div style="width: 400px; background-color: red;float: left;  font-size: 24px; align-content: center;text-align: center;" >Red has been a fundamental color in human history, used since prehistoric times. Neanderthals applied red ochre, derived from hematite, for body decoration as early as 250,000 years ago, with cave paintings in Altamira and Lascaux dating back 14,500–16,500 years.
 Ancient civilizations valued red for its symbolism; Egyptians associated it with life, victory, and the afterlife, while Romans used toxic cinnabar for vibrant vermilion, often linked to power and war.
 In medieval Europe, red symbolized the blood of Christ and divine passion, but its association with luxury led to a decline during the Protestant Reformation.
 The discovery of cochineal insects in Mexico provided a rich, stable red dye, becoming a major trade commodity.
 The 20th century saw the rise of synthetic pigments like cadmium red, offering vibrant, lightfast alternatives.</div>
    <div style="width: 400px; background-color: blue; float: left;font-size: 24px;align-content: center; text-align: center;" >Blue has a surprisingly recent history in human perception and language, with ancient texts like Homer's Odyssey describing the sea as "wine-dark" and the sky as "copper," indicating a lack of a distinct word for blue.
 The color's prominence began with the ancient Egyptians, who created the first synthetic pigment, Egyptian blue, around 2200 B.C..
 They highly valued lapis lazuli, imported from Afghanistan, using it for art and jewelry, which led to the creation of the expensive ultramarine pigment.
 This pigment became associated with the Virgin Mary during the Renaissance, elevating blue's status from a common color to one of holiness and royalty.
 The invention of Prussian blue in 1709 and synthetic ultramarine in the 1820s made blue more accessible, leading to its widespread use in art and culture</div>
    <div style="width: 400px; background-color: green; float: left;font-size: 24px;align-content: center; text-align: center;" >Green, derived from the Old English word "grene," signifies life, growth, and renewal due to its association with chlorophyll in plants.
 Ancient Egyptians used malachite to create green pigment, symbolizing rebirth and prosperity, often depicting gods like Osiris as green.
 The Romans developed verdigris by soaking copper in wine, using it in art and manuscripts.
 During the Middle Ages, green was linked to the devil and envy, reflecting complex cultural views.
 The 18th century saw the invention of Scheele’s Green, a toxic arsenic-based pigment, which was used widely but caused illness and may have contributed to Napoleon's death.
 The 19th century brought Paris Green, similarly hazardous. The Impressionists revived green in art, and today it symbolizes nature, health, and environmentalism, reflecting a shift from its earlier negative connotations.</div>
